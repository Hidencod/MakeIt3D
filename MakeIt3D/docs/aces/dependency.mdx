# üîó Dependency System

The MakeIt3D plugin uses a **dependency system** that creates relationships between your Construct 3 objects and their 3D representations. Understanding this system is crucial for effectively managing 3D objects in your project.

## üìã Overview

Instead of creating 3D objects directly, MakeIt3D uses **placeholder objects** from Construct 3 as references. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Unified Management**: All 3D objects are tied to familiar Construct 3 objects
- **Multiple Instances**: Create many 3D objects from a single placeholder
- **Easy Identification**: Clear naming system for object tracking
- **Flexible Workflow**: Use any Construct 3 object as a placeholder

## üéØ How It Works

### Placeholder Objects
A **placeholder object** can be:
- Any object from your MakeIt3D plugin
- Any existing Construct 3 object (Sprite, Text, etc.)
- An empty object specifically created for 3D references

:::tip Best Practice
Create dedicated empty objects as placeholders to keep your project organized and avoid confusion with gameplay objects.
:::

### Unique ID Generation

When you create a 3D object, MakeIt3D generates a unique identifier using this formula:

```
Unique ID = PlaceholderName + "_" + UID + "_" + InstanceID
```

**Example**: `Hero_3_0`
- `Hero` = Placeholder object name
- `3` = Object's UID in Construct 3
- `0` = Instance ID you provide

## üî¢ Understanding the Components

### 1. Placeholder Object Name
The name of your Construct 3 object that serves as the reference.

![UID Location](/img/dependency_example_img/dependency_example_name.png)

```javascript
// If your placeholder object is named "Hero"
PlaceholderName = "Hero"
```

### 2. UID (Unique Identifier)
Every object in Construct 3 has a UID visible in the Properties panel.

:::info Finding UID
Select your object ‚Üí Check the Properties panel ‚Üí Look for the UID value (usually a number like 2, 3, 5, etc.)
:::

### 3. Instance ID
A number you provide when creating the 3D object to create multiple instances.

```javascript
// Creating multiple instances of the same placeholder
InstanceID = 0  // First instance
InstanceID = 1  // Second instance  
InstanceID = 2  // Third instance
```

## üéÆ Practical Examples




![UID Location](/img/dependency_example_img/placeholder_example_addcube.png)
### Creating Multiple Characters

Let's say you have a placeholder object named "Hero" with UID `3`:

```javascript
// Create different enemy instances
CreateObject("Hero", 0)  // Creates: Hero_3_0
CreateObject("Hero", 1)  // Creates: Hero_3_1  
CreateObject("Hero", 2)  // Creates: Hero_3_2
```

Now you have three different 3D enemies, all based on the same placeholder!

### Accessing Object Properties using expressions

To get the X position of a specific instance:

![UID Location](/img/dependency_example_img/expression_example.png)
```javascript
// Get position X of Enemy_5_1
var posX = MakeIt3D.PositionX("Enemy_5_1");

// Breaking it down:
// "Enemy" = placeholder name
// "5" = UID from Construct 3
// "1" = instance ID
```

## üéØ Using Conditions

### Pick Object By Instance ID

Use this condition to select a specific instance for actions:

1. **Action**: Pick Object By Instance ID
2. **Parameters**: 
   - Placeholder Object: Select your reference object
   - Instance ID: Enter the instance number

```javascript
// This selects Enemy_5_2 for subsequent actions
PickObjectByInstanceID(EnemyPlaceholder, 2)
```
![UID Location](/img/dependency_example_img/pick_condition_1.png)
![UID Location](/img/dependency_example_img/pick_condition_2.png)
![UID Location](/img/dependency_example_img/pick_condition_3.png)
After picking, you can perform actions like:
- Change position
- Modify materials
- Update colors
- Transform the object

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. Organized Naming
Use clear, descriptive names for placeholder objects:

```javascript
‚úÖ Good: "PlayerCharacter", "Enemy_Orc", "Pickup_Coin"
‚ùå Avoid: "Object1", "Temp", "Thing"
```

### 2. Instance ID Management
Keep track of your instance IDs:

```javascript
// Use meaningful instance IDs
Player instances: 0
Enemy instances: 1-10  
Pickups: 11-20
Environment: 21-30
```

### 3. Documentation
Document your placeholder objects and their purposes:

| Placeholder | UID | Purpose | Instance Range |
|-------------|-----|---------|----------------|
| Hero | 3 | Player character | 0 |
| Enemy_Goblin | 5 | Basic enemies | 1-5 |
| Coin | 7 | Collectibles | 10-20 |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Issue: Object Not Found
**Problem**: `MakeIt3D.PositionX("Hero_3_0")` returns undefined

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify the placeholder object name matches exactly
2. ‚úÖ Check the UID in Properties panel
3. ‚úÖ Confirm the instance was created with ID `0`
4. ‚úÖ Ensure the object exists before accessing properties

### Issue: Wrong Object Selected
**Problem**: Actions affect the wrong 3D object

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ Use "Pick Object By Instance ID" before actions
2. ‚úÖ Double-check your instance ID parameters
3. ‚úÖ Verify placeholder object reference is correct

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Dynamic Instance Creation

```javascript
// Create enemies in a loop
for (let i = 0; i < enemyCount; i++) {
    CreateObject("Enemy", i);
    // Each enemy gets ID: Enemy_5_0, Enemy_5_1, Enemy_5_2...
}
```

### Conditional Object Management

```javascript
// Pick and modify specific instances
if (playerLevel > 5) {
    PickObjectByInstanceID(BossPlaceholder, 0);
    // Modify boss properties
}
```

## üìä Quick Reference

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Unique ID Format** | `Name_UID_InstanceID` | `Hero_3_0` |
| **Creating Objects** | Specify placeholder + instance ID | `CreateObject("Hero", 0)` |
| **Picking Objects** | Use condition with placeholder + instance | `PickObjectByInstanceID(Hero, 0)` |
| **Accessing Properties** | Use full unique ID in expressions | `MakeIt3D.PositionX("Hero_3_0")` |
