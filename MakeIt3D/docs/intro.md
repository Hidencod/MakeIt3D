## What is MakeIt3D?

MakeIt3D is a powerful Construct 3 plugin that bridges the gap between 2D game development and 3D graphics. Built on top of the industry-standard Three.js library.

:::danger **Important Technical Note** 
MakeIt3D uses a separate Three.js rendering system that overlays on Construct 3's canvas. 3D objects do not integrate with Construct's layout system, sprite behaviors, or collision detection. This is a standalone 3D rendering solution controlled through events, not an extension of Construct's 2D object system.
:::
### Key Features

- **ðŸŽ¯ Easy Integration** - Add 3D elements to your existing 2D projects 
- **âš¡ High Performance** - Powered by Three.js WebGL renderer
- **ðŸ“± Cross-Platform** - Works across all Construct 3 supported platforms
- **ðŸŽ¨ Rich Materials** - Support for textures, lighting, and advanced materials
- **ðŸ”„ Animation Ready** - Built-in support for 3D animations and transitions

## Quick Start Tutorial

Let's create your first 3D scene in just a few minutes:

### Step 1: Project Setup
```
1. Create a new Construct 3 project
2. Set your layout size (recommended: 1280x720 or higher)
3. Insert â†’ New Object â†’ Plugins â†’ MakeIt3D
```

<!-- ### Step 2: Add Your First 3D Object
```
1. Select your MakeIt3D object
2. In the Properties panel, set:
   - Scene Width: 800
   - Scene Height: 600
   - Enable Auto-Resize: Yes
``` -->

### Step 2: Create 3D Content
Add this to your **Start of Layout** event:
```
System â†’ On start of layout
â”œâ”€ MakeIt3D â†’ Create Scene
â”œâ”€ MakeIt3D â†’ Add Cube (Id, position, rotation, color, scale)
â”œâ”€ MakeIt3D â†’ Set Object Material (Id, color: MakeIt3D.RGB(255,255,0))
â”œâ”€ MakeIt3D â†’ Set Camera Position (x: 0, y: 0, z: 5)
